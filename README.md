# Affiliateo Swift SDK

Mobile affiliate attribution and session tracking for iOS apps (SwiftUI & UIKit).

## Installation

In Xcode: **File → Add Package Dependencies** → paste this URL:

```
https://github.com/affiliateo/affiliateo-swift
```

## Usage (SwiftUI)

Wrap your app with `AffiliateoProvider`:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Affiliateo

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            AffiliateoProvider(appId: "YOUR_APP_ID") {
                ContentView()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Access the attribution state from any view:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var affiliateo: AffiliateoManager

    var body: some View {
        if affiliateo.state.isMatched {
            Text("Referred by: \(affiliateo.state.refCode ?? "")")
        }
    }
}
```

## Track screens (manual)

Screens are tracked when you call `Affiliateo.page(name)` per screen. This matches the Mixpanel / Amplitude model. predictable, no ghost events polluting funnels.

```swift
struct HomeScreen: View {
    var body: some View {
        YourScreenUI()
            .onAppear {
                Affiliateo.page("HomeScreen")
            }
    }
}
```

## Track custom events

For buttons or other moments that matter (signup, trial start, etc.):

```swift
Button("Continue") {
    Affiliateo.track("signup_completed")
    onNext()
}
```

## What it does

- **Identifies the device** using Apple's built-in IDFV (no permissions needed)
- **Tracks sessions** automatically (app foreground)
- **Matches affiliate referrals** via fingerprint matching
- **Sets RevenueCat attributes** automatically if RevenueCat is installed
- **IAP attribution** via StoreKit 2 `appAccountToken`

## Giving affiliates free access (optional)

App owners can switch complimentary access on for an individual affiliate from
their Affiliateo dashboard, which grants a promotional entitlement in their own
RevenueCat project. To make that possible, tell Affiliateo which RevenueCat
customer this device is:

```swift
import RevenueCat

// after Purchases.configure(...)
Affiliateo.setRevenueCatUser(Purchases.shared.appUserID)
```

Call it once, after RevenueCat has configured. Calling it on every launch is
fine and is a no-op after the first time.

Without this, Affiliateo can only match an affiliate to a RevenueCat customer
by email, which requires your app to be setting RevenueCat's `$email` attribute
*and* the affiliate to have used the same address they used on Affiliateo. When
that misses, the owner sees a disabled switch reading "hasn't opened your app
yet".

Notes:

- Separate from `identify()` on purpose. Sign-in and RevenueCat setup happen at
  different moments, and your app may do one without the other.
- Write-once per device. Sending a different ID for a device that is already
  bound is rejected, so a tampered client cannot repoint a device at another
  customer.
- No email or other PII is sent, same as `identify()`.

## Requirements

- iOS 15+
- Swift 5.9+
